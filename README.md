## Project Overview

This project demonstrates core data analysis skills using an online sales transactions dataset. The goal is to clean, analyze, and visualize transactional data to uncover actionable business insights using tools such as **Python**, **Jupyter Notebooks**, and **Power BI**.

The dataset includes order-level details such as product categories, product names, quantity sold, unit price, total revenue, region, and payment method. This provides the opportunity to dive into product performance, geographic sales trends, and payment behavior.
